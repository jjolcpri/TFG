Hello, these are some of the scripts that I had to create in order to automate the use of Earl Grey, BRAKER3 (using the BRAKER2 tool), GeMoMa and GAQET2. They serve as a presentation of my first 'professional' work.\
It is important to point out the code won't work if you just copy paste them because it was created using absolute routes (I thought it would be easier to run that way). The code for GAQET2 won't probably work too, as it was created during a very early state of developement of the tool (v. 0.6.8) and I had to do some tricks in order to get all the info the way I wanted (such as running the program twice).\
