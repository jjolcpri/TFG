Hello, these are some of the scripts that I had to create in order to automate the use of Earl Grey, BRAKER3 (using the BRAKER2 tool) and GeMoMa. They serve as a presentation to my first 'professional' work. It is important to note that the code won't work if you just copy paste them because it was created using absolute routes (I thought it would be easier to run that way).
